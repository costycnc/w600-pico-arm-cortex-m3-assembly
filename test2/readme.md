I insert these files in C:\Users-name-\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\w600\tools\gcc-arm-none-eabi\4_9-2015q1-20150306\bin

So... i installed first package w600-pico in arduino

i compile asm file from https://gist.github.com/BobBurns/bb601d3432650073a8b4

with test.bat verify if arm-none-eabi-as is functional will response with:
