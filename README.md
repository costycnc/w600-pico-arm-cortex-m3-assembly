      The tool can also be obtained by downloading the latest version of the GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain maintained by GCC and ARM developers.
      In order to convert a .bin file to assembly .s file, run the following command:
      arm-none-eabi-objdump -D -bbinary -marm <input.bin> -Mforce-thumb > <output.s>
      where <input.bin> is the full path to the input binary file
      and <output.s> is the full path to a file that will contain the assembly file generated by the t

      @       lets try to blink an LED on the discovery stm32 L1 board
      @       uses LED on PB7 
      @ how to compile and flash:
      @  arm-none-eabi-as -mcpu=cortex-m3 blinky.s -o blinky.o
      @  arm-none-eabi-ld -v -T stm32.ld -nostartfiles -o blinky.elf blinky.o 
      @  arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary blinky.elf blinky.bin
      @ then from st-link (https://github.com/texane/stlink)
      @  ./st-flash write ../first_arm/blinky.bin 0x08000000
